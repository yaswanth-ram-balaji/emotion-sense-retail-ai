## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues:
- **Check Railway logs**: Go to your project → "Deployments" → Click latest deployment
- **Verify environment variables**: Make sure `PORT=8000` is set
- **Check build logs**: Look for any Python/dependency errors

### Frontend Issues:
- **Verify Netlify environment variable**: `VITE_BACKEND_URL` should be your Railway URL
- **Check browser console**: Look for CORS or connection errors
- **Test backend directly**: Visit your Railway URL in browser

### Mobile Issues:
- **Camera permissions**: Allow camera access when prompted
- **HTTPS required**: Make sure you're using https:// URLs
- **Clear browser cache**: Try incognito/private mode

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Railway URL format**: Always ends with `.railway.app`
- **Deployment time**: Usually 2-3 minutes for backend
- **Free tier limits**: 500 hours/month (plenty for testing)
- **Logs are your friend**: Check Railway logs if anything fails

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Railway deployment fails**: Check the build logs in Railway dashboard
2. **Frontend can't connect**: Verify the environment variable in Netlify
3. **Mobile camera issues**: Check browser permissions and use HTTPS

Your app will now work fully on mobile with permanent cloud hosting! 🎉
