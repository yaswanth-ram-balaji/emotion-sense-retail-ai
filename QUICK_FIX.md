# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix Guide - If Something Goes Wrong

## Problem 1: "Railway deployment failed"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure these files exist in your GitHub repo:
   - `main.py` âœ… (should be there)
   - `requirements.txt` âœ… (should be there)
2. Try again - sometimes Railway is just busy

## Problem 2: "Frontend can't connect to backend"

**Solution**:
1. Check your Railway URL is correct
2. Make sure it starts with `https://` (not `http://`)
3. In Netlify environment variables, make sure:
   - Variable name: `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
   - Variable value: Your Railway URL (like `https://something.railway.app`)

## Problem 3: "Camera doesn't work on mobile"

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're using `https://cute-lily-7bee8d.netlify.app` (with `https`)
2. Allow camera permissions when browser asks
3. Try refreshing the page

## Problem 4: "I can't find my Railway URL"

**Solution**:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Look for "Domains" section
5. Copy the URL that ends with `.railway.app`

## Problem 5: "Everything is broken!"

**Solution**:
1. Don't panic! ðŸ˜Š
2. Check if your Netlify site works: https://cute-lily-7bee8d.netlify.app
3. If it loads but camera doesn't work, it's just a backend connection issue
4. Follow Problem 2 solution above
